Two sets of elements were given to find the sum of all distinct elements from the set.
A procedure was written and called dot_product which calculates in the variable, the dot(scalar) product of v1 and v2.
An algorithm was determined, for n pairs of given vectors, whether two vectors of given IR are orthogonal, by calling the procedure defined in the previous question. The dot product of two orthogonal vectors is zero.
